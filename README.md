# Code for DC — New Website

This repo will power the new Code for DC website, once it’s done.

Currently, it mostly consists of files from [Chi Hack Night](http://chihacknight.org/)’s website, which we’re using primarily because their site has a lot of functionality that we’re looking for (and it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel), but the design will end up being fairly different.

You can see this new site live at [new.codefordc.org](https://new.codefordc.org/).

Once complete, this will replace the [existing Code for DC website](https://codefordc.org/).
